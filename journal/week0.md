# Getting the AWS CLI Working
Proceeding to install the account

# Install AWS CLI
 -We install our AWS CLI when the Gitpod environment launches

 -We are going to set AWS CLI to use partial aoutoprompt mode to make it easier to debug CLI commands.

 -The bash commands we are using are the same as the [AWS CLI install instruction]https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

## Update our .gitpod.yml to include the following task.
 
  tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
       cd /workspace
       curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
       unzip awscliv2.zip
       sudo ./aws/install
       cd $THIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
